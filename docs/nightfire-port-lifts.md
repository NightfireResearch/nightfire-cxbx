# Functions taken from nightfire-port

[nightfire-port](https://github.com/Jeffsteelflex/nightfire-port) (Jeffsteelflex) reimplements the PS2 build's
action engine, and its owner has given us permission to use it (16 October 2026, to be put in writing in its
next release). This file records what is taken from it.

Our authority is still `default.xbe`. Their code is a reading of the PS2's MIPS: PS2 struct layouts (`obj_tag`
0x110 bytes against the Xbox's 0xe4, `Drone_tag` 0xd20 against 0x978), PS2 maths (`PS2Sinf`, VU0, the EE's
division) and comments in Portuguese. So each function is ported from the Xbox's own code, with theirs as a guide
to what it does. A function ported that way:
- is written to docs/style-guide.md against our Xbox structures, with our tags (`AUTOINJECT`, `FUNC_AT`);
- carries the GameCube build's checks (docs/gamecube-checks.md);
- notes in this file what their reading got wrong, if anything, so it can go back to them.

## How a parcel is checked

1. `tools/demo/demo_coverage.py` lists which of the parcel's functions the time demos reach, before porting.
2. The functions are ported.
3. `tools/demo/play_demos.ps1` plays every demo. All must still match frame for frame.
4. A function the demos do not reach gets a shadow test or a replay of its own (`src/action/devtools`), or is
   listed below as unverified.

## Parcels

| # | Their files | Functions | Reached by the demos | Commit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | script, script_support, script_player, simple_script, drone_script | 36 + 8 they inline or split differently | 31 of 36. Shadow-tested: Script_Set2Start, SP_Hit, and the three weight helpers (ScriptShadow.cpp, 650 cases). Checked against the disassembly only: Script_FreeFromHashTable. Unverified: Player_Cam2Mode, Drone_CoderCreate | see git log |

| 2 | trigger, door, sensor, player_stats | 45 + 6 (Trigger_Hit, PlrStats_GetDrivingData, Door_SetupSlide, Door_IsOpen, Door_MoveGroup, Door_CloseIfClear) | 40 of 45; 459 of 549 blocks. Every function, and the missed branches, shadow-tested (TriggerShadow, DoorShadow, SecurityShadow, PlrStatShadow: 44,050 cases, 0 differ; each suite shown to catch a planted bug) | see git log |

| 3 | drone_sm, drone_func, drone_behaviour | 32 + 8 (Drone_SM_QueueMsg, DroneAnim_CurrentMoveState, DroneAnim_SetWalkIdleAnim, NDrone2_GetHeadPosOld, NDrone2_PatrolTalk, NDrone2_PowerstationTalk, NDrone2_HandleTalking, NDrone2_FadeOut) | 30 of 32; 391 of 624 blocks. DroneAIShadow: 136,925 cases, 0 differ; 33 planted bugs, 31 caught (the other two need a NaN, or are a branch that cannot be reached) | see git log |

Parcel 1's first playback found two things the coverage alone would not have shown:
- **A crash in our code.** The port of `Script_CreateEntity` called our `Break_Create` by name, which is a known-broken
  draft that was never patched in. `tools/draft_calls.py` now finds such calls.
- **A gap in the demos themselves:** the collision stamp (see docs/action-timedemo.md).

## Where their reading differs from the Xbox

### Parcel 1
- `Script_SoundEnd`, `Script_EntityEnd`, `Script_SubScriptEnd`, `Script_LightEnd`, `Script_TextStart`,
  `Script_AnimEnd`, `Script_CameraEnd`, `Script_SpriteEnd` and `Script_FadeStart` are separate functions there.
  On the Xbox they are inline in `Script_Run`.
- `Script_FreeFromHashTable` skips freeing the -1 a wrong-version script leaves. The Xbox frees it (an original
  bug, kept).
- `SS_Activate` takes two arguments there; the Xbox's reads one.
- `Script_Interp`'s footstep test reads the AnimObj's flags there. The Xbox reads `AnimState`+0x50
  (`animFlags & 4`).
- Platform differences, not errors: `Script_SpriteStart` rescales its coordinates to 512x448 on the PS2, where the
  Xbox stores them raw; the PS2's camera block is 0x50 bytes, the Xbox's 0x48.

Everything else in their readings of parcel 1 matched the Xbox.

### Parcel 2
- `Trigger_Hit`, bullets: the field at the weapon definition's +2 is `weaponBaseNum`, not the ammo type.
- `InverterTrigger_Update` indexes the channels with the sign-extended short. Theirs masks it to 0-255.
- `SSys_Msg`:
  - Their comment says only laser 2 speaks in TowerC. The Xbox, and their own code, silence every item.
  - The four message tables are not in item order in memory: items 1-4 are at 0x18cc50, 0x18cc18, 0x18ccc0 and
    0x18cc88.
  - The Xbox has no guard against a message index of 7 or more.
- `Monitor_Create` takes 4 arguments, not 5.
- The door group state array has 101 entries (a memset of 0xca bytes), not 104.
- Their own additions: guards on a NULL user and viewer, a rows check in `PlrStats_ResetScoring`, and the channel
  clamps.

Everything else in their readings of parcel 2 matched the Xbox.

### Parcel 3
- Inlined on the Xbox: `DroneFunc_DropGrenade`.
- A call on the Xbox where theirs is inline: the "drone active" test in `DroneFunc_DoForcedAttack` and
  `NDrone2_PowerstationTalk` calls `MPDrone_MaybeIsDyingOrDead` (0x1a190); `Drone_MayhewTalk` inlines it.
- `DroneFunc_OnInitDeath`'s death log is a call to `NDrone2_LogDroneDeath` for every enemy whose flags lack
  0x1000000. Theirs tests "killed by the player" around `PlrStat_LogEnemyDispatched`.
- `NDrone2_NearArmedPerson` takes only the DCVars on the Xbox; theirs also takes a radius.
- `NDrone2_ExplosionDir` reads the impact position at +0x8, not +0x10 (layout).
- `DroneFunc_ConsiderExplosive`'s fuse timeout is ((2 x rate + fuse) + frame) on the x87; theirs adds frame + fuse +
  2 x rate in float.
- `DroneFunc_DoBondTalk` and `NDrone2_BondTalk` work their timeouts out in extended precision and truncate with
  `__ftol2`. Theirs uses float rounding and `fptoui`: PS2 maths.
- Their own additions: a drop on a full queue in `Drone_SM_RouteMsg`, the `ch < 256` guard in
  `NDrone2_PowerstationTalk`, and a NULL-player guard in `DroneAnim_LocationDeathAnim`.

Everything else in their readings of parcel 3 matched the Xbox.

## Original bugs found while porting (kept; candidates for FIX_ORIGINAL_GAME_BUGS)

- `Script_Load`, a file with 0x3f streams or more: hands its record to `DList_RemoveFromInUse2Free(&ScriptList)`,
  a list it was never in, and leaves it in the hashtable.
- `Script_FreeFromHashTable`: calls `Mem_Free` on the -1 left for a wrong-version script file.
- `Script_EntityStart` writes as many placement parameters into `tptr` as the stream gives, and
  `Script_EventHandler` reads as many arguments into `args[8]`: neither is bounded.
- `Script_CreateEntity` compares the object's type with the placement type for switch, destroy, trigger, pickup
  and emitter entities. They never match, so those objects are always deleted and created again, never reused.
- `FuseBox_Update`: a broken fuse of list 1 clears list 0's second channel.
- `SP_LoadScript` loads script 0's loadable part, whichever script is active.
- `Door_Create` never checks that `control_create_object` succeeded.
- Unchecked dereferences of the user: `Door_Activate` (one-way and swing doors). Unchecked dereferences of the
  user, viewer and sensor data: `Monitor_Update` and `Monitor_Activate`.
- `PlrStats_SetupScoreTable` trusts the count it is given.
- Channel and message indexes in triggers, doors and the security system are never bounded. Trigger inputs above
  255 read and write `switch_channels_hold`.
- The AI message queue's insert (0x4e3c0) writes through NULL when all 1022 items are in use.
- `Drone_SM_RouteMsg` ignores a failed `Drone_DCVfromOBJ` and carries on with uninitialised DCVars.
- `DroneAnim_LocationDeathAnim` uses `glb_players[0]` and its animState without checking them.
- `NDrone2_GetHeadPos` writes `*pos` unchecked for objects that are not drones.

## Departures from the original

- The AI dispatcher's Exit, Enter and 0x2e messages leave their scope and frames as uninitialised stack in the
  original. Ours writes zero there, as the driving engine's port does for uninitialised stack
  (docs/driving/original-quirks.md, 1.1).

## What the demos do not cover

The recorded set (tests/demos/action) is single player, started with `-level`. It does not reach multiplayer
(`MP_*`, the bots `BOT_*`/`BOTSTATE_*`/`BOTWEAP_*`/`DSTATE_Bot*`, split screen and its rendering), the front end
and its menus, or saving and loading. Parcels in those areas need their own recordings first. The recorder takes
all four controller ports, so a split-screen or bot match can be recorded. A launch option to boot straight into
a multiplayer match, like `-level`, would make that practical. Until then, those parcels come last, with shadow
tests and MenuProbe replays as their check.
